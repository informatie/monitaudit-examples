"""
monitaudit thread trace-isolation example.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates that multiple traced root functions can execute concurrently
on separate ThreadPoolExecutor workers while maintaining independent trace
contexts.

The example starts exactly three root tasks using:

    ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)

Each root task calls one nested traced child function.

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_thread_trace_isolation.yaml

Execution model
---------------
Three root operations run concurrently:

    trace-worker_0
        root(1)
            child(1)

    trace-worker_1
        root(2)
            child(2)

    trace-worker_2
        root(3)
            child(3)

The exact task-to-thread assignment is controlled by Python and the
operating system and may differ between runs.

Trace relationship
------------------
Every root() invocation is an independent root trace:

    root.call_id = unique UUID
    root.parent_call_id = None

The nested child() call receives the active root call as its parent:

    child.call_id = unique UUID
    child.parent_call_id = root.call_id

The important relationship is therefore:

    child.parent_call_id
        ==
    root.call_id

for the same task_id.

Demonstrates
------------
- ThreadPoolExecutor
- three concurrent worker threads
- independent root traces
- nested child traces
- ContextVar isolation between workers
- call_id
- parent_call_id
- automatic parameter capture
- function_start
- function_end
- duration_ms
- structured thread information
- thread_name
- thread_id

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating tracing with threads
- validating ContextVar isolation
- checking that concurrent traces do not share call_id
- checking parent_call_id relationships
- checking nested traces inside worker threads
- testing ConsoleSink with concurrent traces
- inspecting thread relationships in JsonSink
- checking tracing after ContextVar changes

Expected result
---------------
There should be three independent root traces.

Each root should:
- have a unique call_id
- have parent_call_id = None
- execute exactly one child trace

Each child should:
- have its own unique call_id
- have parent_call_id equal to its root call_id
- use the same task_id as its root
- execute on the same worker thread as its root

There should normally be:
- 3 root function_start records
- 3 root function_end records
- 3 child function_start records
- 3 child function_end records
- 0 function_error records

Do not use this example when
----------------------------
- testing multiprocessing
- testing async tracing
- testing worker failures
- testing large task queues
- benchmarking monitaudit performance

Dedicated examples should be used for those scenarios.
