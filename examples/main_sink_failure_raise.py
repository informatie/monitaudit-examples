"""
monitaudit sink-failure isolation example using raise mode.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates how monitaudit behaves when one configured sink fails while
sink_failure_mode is set to:

    raise

A deliberately broken sink is inserted before the normally configured
monitaudit sinks.

When monitaudit writes a log record:

- BrokenSink is called first
- BrokenSink deliberately raises RuntimeError
- monitaudit records the sink failure internally
- monitaudit continues attempting the remaining sinks
- ConsoleSink can still receive the record
- JsonSink can still receive the record
- FileSink can still receive the record
- after all sinks have been attempted, monitaudit raises RuntimeError
- the application can catch that final monitaudit exception

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_sink_failure_raise.yaml

Demonstrates
------------
- sink failure isolation
- sink_failure_mode = raise
- deliberately failing sink
- remaining sinks still being attempted
- RuntimeError after sink processing
- original sink exception preserved as __cause__
- application handling of the monitaudit failure
- successful sinks writing before the final exception is raised

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating monitauditLogger._write()
- testing sink_failure_mode = raise
- confirming all sinks are attempted before failure is propagated
- checking exception chaining
- comparing raise behaviour with the continue-mode example

Expected behaviour
------------------
BrokenSink raises:

    RuntimeError("Deliberate BrokenSink failure")

monitaudit should report the individual sink failure to stderr.

monitaudit should still attempt the other configured sinks.

After all sinks have been attempted, monitaudit should raise:

    RuntimeError(
        "monitaudit sink failure(s): BrokenSink"
    )

The raised monitaudit RuntimeError should have the original BrokenSink
RuntimeError as its __cause__.

Important
---------
This behaviour is different from sink_failure_mode = continue.

continue:

    BrokenSink fails
        -> remaining sinks run
        -> application continues normally

raise:

    BrokenSink fails
        -> remaining sinks run
        -> monitaudit raises after sink processing
        -> application receives RuntimeError

Expected output files
---------------------
Even though the application receives RuntimeError afterwards, the configured
working sinks should already have received the record.

Check:

    logs/examples/main_sink_failure_raise.log

    logs/examples/main_sink_failure_raise.jsonl

Do not use this example when
----------------------------
- validating continue mode
- testing a real filesystem failure
- testing Delta infrastructure failures
- benchmarking sink performance

Use main_sink_failure_continue.py for continue-mode behaviour.
