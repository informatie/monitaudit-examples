"""
monitaudit ThreadPoolExecutor failure-handling example.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates what happens when one traced worker task fails while other
worker tasks complete successfully.

The example creates exactly three tasks using:

    ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)

Task 2 deliberately raises RuntimeError.

Tasks 1 and 3 complete successfully.

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_thread_failure.yaml

Execution model
---------------
Three tasks are submitted:

    task(1) -> success
    task(2) -> RuntimeError
    task(3) -> success

Because task() is decorated with @obs.trace, monitaudit automatically creates:

Successful task:

    function_start
        ->
    function_end

Failed task:

    function_start
        ->
    function_error

The exception raised by task(2) is stored in the Future.

The main thread later receives that exception when:

    future.result()

is called.

The outer application catches the RuntimeError, writes a structured warning,
and continues collecting the remaining futures.

Demonstrates
------------
- ThreadPoolExecutor
- max_workers = 3
- concurrent traced tasks
- successful worker execution
- worker failure
- Future exception propagation
- function_start
- function_end
- function_error
- error_type
- error_message
- traceback
- handling worker exceptions in the main thread
- continuing after one worker task fails
- collecting futures with as_completed()

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating @obs.trace inside ThreadPoolExecutor
- testing worker exceptions
- verifying function_error records
- checking Future exception propagation
- validating that successful workers are unaffected
- testing thread trace isolation after failures
- checking JsonSink error information
- checking FileSink traceback output

Expected result
---------------
Exactly three task executions occur.

Expected task results:

    task(1) -> success
    task(2) -> failure
    task(3) -> success

Expected trace lifecycle:

    task(1)
        function_start = 1
        function_end   = 1
        function_error = 0

    task(2)
        function_start = 1
        function_end   = 0
        function_error = 1

    task(3)
        function_start = 1
        function_end   = 1
        function_error = 0

Totals:

    function_start = 3
    function_end   = 2
    function_error = 1

The task(2) function_error should contain:

    error_type    = RuntimeError
    error_message = Deliberate worker failure
    traceback     = populated

Important
---------
The worker exception does not disappear.

@obs.trace logs the function_error and then re-raises the original exception.

ThreadPoolExecutor stores that exception in the Future.

Calling:

    future.result()

re-raises it in the main thread.

The example deliberately handles that exception so processing of the other
Future results can continue.
