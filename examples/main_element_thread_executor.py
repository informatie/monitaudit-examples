"""
monitaudit element-level ThreadPoolExecutor example.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates concurrent element processing using exactly three worker
threads.

Unlike the workspace-level executor example, the individual elements are
submitted directly to the ThreadPoolExecutor.

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_element_thread_executor.yaml

Execution model
---------------
The executor is configured with:

    max_workers = 3

Nine independent element tasks are submitted:

    task(0)
    task(1)
    task(2)
    ...
    task(8)

At most three worker threads execute concurrently.

Every invocation of task() is decorated with @obs.trace, so every element
processing operation becomes its own independent root trace.

Demonstrates
------------
- ThreadPoolExecutor
- exactly three worker threads
- nine submitted element tasks
- worker reuse
- concurrent traced functions
- independent call_id values
- parent_call_id for root traces
- automatic parameter capture
- function_start
- function_end
- duration_ms
- thread_name
- thread_id
- collecting results with as_completed()

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating element-level parallel processing
- checking thread reuse
- checking independent trace contexts
- checking call_id uniqueness
- checking parent_call_id on root traces
- checking thread names in JsonSink
- checking thread IDs in JsonSink
- testing ContextVar isolation between workers

Expected behaviour
------------------
All nine tasks should complete successfully.

Every task should produce:

    function_start = 1
    function_end   = 1
    function_error = 0

Totals:

    function_start = 9
    function_end   = 9
    function_error = 0

Because task() is submitted directly to the executor, every invocation is
an independent root trace.

Therefore:

    task.call_id
        = unique

    task.parent_call_id
        = None

The executor can use at most three worker threads.

Important
---------
Thread scheduling is controlled by Python and the operating system.

max_workers=3 means that no more than three executor workers execute
simultaneously. It does not guarantee a particular task-to-thread mapping.

The short sleep is deliberate so concurrency and worker reuse are easier to
observe. This example is not intended as a performance benchmark.
