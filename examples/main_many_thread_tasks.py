"""
monitaudit many-thread-tasks example.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates how a ThreadPoolExecutor with three worker threads processes
more tasks than there are workers.

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_many_thread_tasks.yaml

The example creates:

    workers = 3
    tasks   = 20

Because there are substantially more tasks than worker threads, each worker
must be reused to process multiple tasks.

Every task is decorated with @obs.trace.

Execution model
---------------
The executor is configured with:

    ThreadPoolExecutor(
        max_workers=3,
        thread_name_prefix="many-task-worker",
    )

Twenty tasks are submitted:

    task(0)
    task(1)
    task(2)
    ...
    task(19)

At most three worker threads execute tasks concurrently.

As workers complete tasks, they are reused for later tasks.

Demonstrates
------------
- ThreadPoolExecutor
- max_workers = 3
- 20 submitted tasks
- worker-thread reuse
- concurrent traced functions
- independent call_id values
- function_start
- function_end
- duration_ms
- automatic parameter capture
- thread_name
- thread_id
- task completion tracking
- worker utilisation summary

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating traced functions in a worker pool
- demonstrating worker reuse
- checking thread names in monitaudit logs
- checking thread IDs in monitaudit logs
- validating many independent root traces
- checking trace counts
- checking parameter capture for task numbers

Expected behaviour
------------------
Twenty tasks should execute successfully.

Each task should generate:

    function_start
    function_end

Therefore the expected trace totals are:

    function_start = 20
    function_end   = 20
    function_error = 0

Each task should have:
- its own call_id
- parent_call_id = None
- parameters.number containing the task number

The executor can use up to three threads.

A task may execute on any of those workers. Worker assignment is controlled
by Python and the operating system and should not be hard-coded in tests.

Important
---------
The sleep is deliberate.

Without a small simulated workload, tasks may complete so quickly that the
runtime has little opportunity to make worker reuse and concurrency visible.

This is an monitaudit concurrency demonstration, not a performance benchmark.
