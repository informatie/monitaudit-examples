"""
monitaudit ConsoleSink example.

Purpose
-------
Demonstrates monitaudit's human-readable console output and, in particular,
the indentation produced by ConsoleSink for nested traced functions.

The monitaudit configuration is loaded from:

    examples/config/main_console_sink.yaml

The example creates a three-level trace hierarchy:

    process_pipeline
        process_workspace
            process_element

Normal obs.info() messages are also written inside each traced function.

This makes it possible to visually inspect how ConsoleSink represents:

- root traces
- nested traces
- logs inside traced functions
- function_start
- function_end
- call depth
- module/function locations

Demonstrates
------------
- ConsoleSink
- @obs.trace
- three-level nested tracing
- function_start
- function_end
- nested indentation
- call_id
- parent_call_id
- normal logging inside traces
- automatic parameter capture
- default parameter capture
- duration_ms
- trace-depth cleanup

Use this example when
---------------------
- validating ConsoleSink
- checking indentation
- testing nested trace depth
- checking ContextVar nesting
- checking parent_call_id relationships
- testing ConsoleSink after internal changes
- demonstrating trace hierarchy visually

Expected behaviour
------------------
The console should show a hierarchy similar to:

    process_pipeline started
        Pipeline running
        process_workspace started
            Workspace running
            process_element started
                Element running
            process_element completed
            process_element started
                Element running
            process_element completed
            Workspace completed
        process_workspace completed
        Pipeline completed
    process_pipeline completed

The actual lines additionally contain timestamp, level and function location.

Important
---------
ConsoleSink indentation is based on the trace depth stored using call_id and
parent_call_id relationships.

The start and end records for one traced function should appear at the same
indentation depth.

Ordinary logs generated inside the traced function are displayed one level
deeper.

This example is intentionally successful. No function_error events should
be produced.
